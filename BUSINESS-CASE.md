## 1. The Problem We're Solving

### Before Zuddl Task:
❌ **Scattered Communication:** Tasks discussed in calls but lost in email threads and chat messages  
❌ **No Accountability:** Unclear who's responsible for what  
❌ **Progress Blindness:** No visibility into what's done, in-progress, or blocked  
❌ **Manual Tracking:** Hours wasted updating spreadsheets and chasing team members  
❌ **Missed Deadlines:** No systematic alerts for overdue tasks  
❌ **No Performance Insights:** Cannot measure individual or team productivity
